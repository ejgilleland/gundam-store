## Gundam Store

A web application to replicate a small version of the usa gundam store

## Getting Started

Take a look at the issues tab in this repository.  You will see the wire frame for each feature, along with some details about each feature.

## Workflow

1. Before you begin a feature, you are required to take a look at the issue you are working on.

1. At the bottom of the issue you will see a task list for each feature.  You will need to modify the issue and create your own task list to accomplish the feature.  The issue is written in markdown, I left an example check box in there for you to go off of.

1. Once you feel your task list is ready, send it to me for approval, and I can let you know if it is ready to go or not.

1. Once you have received approval from me, you can create a new branch to build out your feature.  Your branch name should the name of the feature you are working on.  For example:
    - Feature: User Can View App
    - Branch: user-can-view-app

1. After you have completed the feature, open a pull request to your master branch, and send me the link to your pull request for approval.  Please remember to include a screenshot.

1. Once your pull request is approved do the following:

    - `git checkout master`
    - `git pull origin master`

1. Then continue the work flow from the issues portion till the application is completed.

Remember to always update your issues as you are working through the project. It helps me see your progress and helps you stay on track.

And finally have fun with it, the wire frames were created in a way for you to add your own creative touch in terms of color.
